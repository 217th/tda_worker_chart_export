2025-12-19:
- Installed pytest into repo venv: `.venv/bin/pip install -U pytest`.
- Ran CLI unit tests:
  - Command: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/tasks/T-009/test_cli.py`
  - Result: PASS (5 passed)

Manual scenario checks:
- Not executed: core engine is still NotImplemented (T-009 scopes CLI adapter only), so end-to-end CLI scenarios with real flow_run/step cannot be run yet.
