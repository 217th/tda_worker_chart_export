T-031 verification (docs-only)

Checks performed:
- Confirmed `docs/workflow/cloud_run_functions_gen2_deploy_first_try.md` contains placeholders only (no real project IDs, bucket names, service account emails, URLs).
- Confirmed content covers:
  - first deploy vs update deploy
  - ENTRY_POINT agent-derived
  - robust env vars input (file vs inline)
  - requirements.txt presence check
  - trigger SA vs runtime SA separation
  - trigger-diff guard on update deploy
  - Eventarc + Firestore and Eventarc + Storage notes (incl. transport pitfalls)

No code/runtime tests were required for this docs-only task.
